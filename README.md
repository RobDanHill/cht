# cht

`cht` is a Rust CLI for [cht.sh](https://cht.sh).

__I am unaffiliated with cht.sh. This is merely a hobby project.__

cht.sh's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) advertises an [existing CLI](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#command-line-client-chtsh),
and it is feature complete. I recommend looking into their CLI instead of this one since I intended
it as an introductory project and my foray into Rust.

Any constructive feedback is appreciated ðŸ™‚
